# The-perfect-guess
 you can create a program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it. The program continuously takes the user's input and provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. If the user correctly guesses the number, the program terminates, displaying the number of guesses made by the player. The process involves conditional statements to compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number, and a loop structure to iterate until the correct guess is made. Additionally, the program can incorporate features such as recording and updating a high score based on the fewest guesses required by the player. This can be implemented using variables, loops, conditional statements, and file handling in a programming language like Python, Java, C++, or others
